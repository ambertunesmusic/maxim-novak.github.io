<h2>
      International Collaboration
     </h2>
<p>
      In 2025, two tracks from Maxim Novak’s new album were selected by Shanghai Jinjia Company for integration into five “Living Stream” rooms on Douyin (Chinese TikTok), as part of the launch of their new cosmetic brand, KIMTRUE. The music is featured with full credit (“Music by Maxim Novak”) and will remain in rotation through November 28, 2025. This collaboration marks a warm and professional cross-cultural exchange, reflecting the emotional reach and cinematic quality of Maxim’s music.
      His work is also featured by <strong>The Independent Film School</strong>, an educational platform supporting aspiring filmmakers around the world.</p>
<p>
      Previously, Maxim collaborated with Ukrainian video editor and traveler Svetlana Bilik on a YouTube series titled *Music and Travel*. Her beautifully edited videos — filmed in Venice, Barcelona, Vienna and beyond — were accompanied by his original music and often reached tens of thousands of views. Though the project paused due to the war, it remains a cherished example of international creative connection.
