<div class="about-text">
<p><strong>Maxim Novak</strong> is a composer of instrumental music with a nostalgic, cinematic touch — blending elements of jazz, bossa nova, retro, and folk traditions. His melodies have been featured in multiple documentary films, hundreds of YouTube and TikTok videos, and artistic collaborations with creators around the world. His music is available on platforms like <a href="https://freemusicarchive.org/music/maxim-novak/" target="_blank">Free Music Archive</a> and Spotify. In 2024, the Free Music Archive published a dedicated article highlighting his unique emotional and melodic style. He is also listed on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm17047519/?ref_=ttfc_fcr_cr" target="_blank">IMDb</a> for his contributions to film scoring.</p>

<h2>International Collaboration</h2>
<p>In 2025, two tracks from Maxim Novak’s new album were selected by Shanghai Jinjia Company for integration into five “Living Stream” rooms on Douyin (Chinese TikTok), as part of the launch of their new cosmetic brand, KIMTRUE. The music is featured with full credit (“Music by Maxim Novak”) and will remain in rotation through November 28, 2025. This collaboration marks a warm and professional cross-cultural exchange, reflecting the emotional reach and cinematic quality of Maxim’s music.</p><p>Previously, Maxim collaborated with Ukrainian video editor and traveler Svetlana Bilik on a YouTube series titled *Music and Travel*. Her beautifully edited videos — filmed in Venice, Barcelona, Vienna and beyond — were accompanied by his original music and often reached tens of thousands of views. Though the project paused due to the war, it remains a cherished example of international creative connection.</p></div>
